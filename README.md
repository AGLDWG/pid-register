# AGLDWG PID Register

<mark>Early Stage Work - incomplete!</mark>

This repository contains the source information for the [Australian Government Linked Data Working Group](https://www.linked.data.gov.au) (AGLDWG)'s Persistent Identifier (PID) register. The register maintains PIDs within the `linked.data.gov.au` namespace.

The AGLDWG created PIDs for three types of thing:

* Organisations
    * for any organisation that submits PID requests to the AGLDWG
* Definitional Items
    * Linked Data ontologies, vocabularies, profiles, etc.
* Datasets
    * Linked Data datasets online

PIDs for all these items redirect to their human- and machine-readable home locations online which are provided by the PID registers, not the AGLDWG.
