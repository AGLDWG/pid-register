    schema:description """The International Seabed Geomorphology Mapping Working Group (ISGM) is a collaboration between geoscience agencies in the United Kingdom, Norway, Ireland and Australia. The group have been collaborating since 2016 to develop a novel marine and coastal system that supports standardised geomorphic classification and mapping by a broad range of geoscientists. Users can download open-access reports and GIS tools or use the online vocabularies to apply the method to their own datasets.""" ;
