The IAG/AIG was founded at the Second International Conference on Geomorphology in Frankfurt/Main (Germany) in 1989 in order to strengthen international geomorphology. IAG/AIG fulfils its aims through the establishment of working groups and task forces, organisation of international and regional conferences, publication activity and information exchange. Membership of the IAG/AIG is normally by countries. At present, 63 countries are affiliated to the IAG/AIG through their National Scientific Members.
