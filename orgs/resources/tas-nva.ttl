    schema:description "The Natural Values Atlas provides authoritative and comprehensive information on Tasmania's natural values. It draws together, in one centralised location, data on Tasmanian flora and fauna including threatened species and weeds, as well as Tasmanian geodiversity and soil survey data. It also incorporates access to other essential data sets such as TASVEG and Threatened Native Vegetation Communities maps. The Natural Values Atlas allows observations of plants and animals from various sources to be viewed, recorded and analysed. It can be used to search for information on plant and animal species from Tasmania, Australia and can display maps showing their location and extent. The observations of plants and animals recorded in the Natural Values Atlas have been collected by a variety of custodians through general species surveys and projects undertaken for scientific research, environmental assessments, and other purposes throughout the State since the 1800's. The Natural Values Atlas provides data products such as the Natural Values Report, which brings several data sets together providing a resource that can be used for desktop assessments of natural values for specific areas. Core repository for biodiversity data held by the Tasmanian Government." ;
