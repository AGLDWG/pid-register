Between 2016 and 2018, a group of 17 organizations with a shared purpose invested their time and energy into an Org ID initiative, with the goal of defining requirements for an open, community-led organization identifier registry. The initiative was a transparent, accessible process to help work towards a better system for all of our communities.""" ;
